## Project Description

This project is my way of taking a delightful trip down memory lane, back to the early 2000s‚Äîa time of AOL Instant Messenger, MySpace, and the early days of online creativity. It was an exciting era of innovation and discovery.

You'll find the classic sections‚ÄîAbout, Projects, and Contact‚Äîinside the Maxthon Browser on the desktop. Think of it as blending nostalgic charm with modern tech, all wrapped up in the iconic XP style.

## To-Do

- **Add more applications:** Plan to include additional applications to enhance the desktop experience.
- **Improve responsiveness:** Ensure the layout is fully responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
- **Refine UI/UX:** Make further improvements to the user interface and experience based on feedback.
- **Bug fixes:** Continue to identify and fix any bugs that may arise.
- **Minimize Code/Refactor** This is my first time using Sveltekit, I love it because its easier to get started. The drawback is there aren't many examples of standards on how projects should be structured. This will a continous improvement.
